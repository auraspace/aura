# Technical Debt

Standing log of temporary workarounds, incomplete behavior, and deferred follow-ups.

When you introduce or discover debt, add an entry here in the same change.
When you resolve debt, update or remove the matching entry.

## Open

### Array field return still moves (no true borrow type)

- Area: builtin Array (C7c/C8j)
- Symptom: `return this.items` still moves buffer out of the object; bind/assign from field is non-owning view (C8j)
- Why deferred: no `ref`/`borrow` type in the language; shallow view is enough for field reads
- Next step: optional deep clone API or true borrow type if needed
- Introduced: narrowed after C8j

### No registry fetch / semver resolve

- Area: toolchain / RFC-005
- Symptom: path deps + lock; C8k parses registry pin form but does not fetch or resolve ranges
- Why deferred: monorepo path graph enough for demos
- Progress: C8b path existence; C8k `LockEntry` version/source/checksum schema
- Next step: registry HTTP client + caret ranges in `aura.toml`
- Introduced: narrowed after C3p; nested C4j; path check C8b; schema C8k

### Array of interface elements

- Area: builtin Array
- Symptom: interface elements rejected (C4x/C7h message); enum/class/struct/prim/Array OK
- Decision (C7h): **reject for MVP** — no `Array<I>` until a stable elem layout exists
- Why: interface values are closed-world fat/tag unions; Array mono needs fixed elem size today
- Next step (post-MVP): erase to fat pointer `(tag, data*)` or box each element as a class
- Introduced: narrowed after C6g; decision locked C7h

### Array element drop incomplete (non-Array elems)

- Area: builtin Array
- Symptom: C8f deep-frees nested Array elems on drop/clear/set; prim/class/enum/struct still buffer-only
- Why deferred: class elems are GC; prim/struct/enum need no free; only nested Array owned buffers
- Next step: if user types with owned buffers appear as elems, extend free loop
- Introduced: narrowed after C7j; nested free C8f

### Stdlib collections polish

- Area: stdlib / RFC-007
- Symptom: linear `Map`/`Set`; `HashMap` String→Int fixed capacity 16; no resize, no generic HashMap
- Why deferred: open-addressing MVP is enough for demos
- Next step: resize; `HashMap<K,V>` when hashable protocol exists
- Introduced: narrowed after C8i

### Generic class implements interface

- Area: language / C8c
- Symptom: non-generic classes may implement mono ifaces (`: Iterable<Int>`); generic classes still reject implements (C2b)
- Why deferred: class mono × iface mono matrix
- Next step: allow `class Box<T> : Iterable<T>` with mono variants
- Introduced: C2b; remains after C8c

## Resolved

### Generic `Iterable<E>` implements (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C8c/C8d: `implements TypeRef` with args; `Ty::InterfaceApp`; method subst; mono iface codegen; `std.collections.Iterable<E>`; for-in.

### Nested Array mono + element free (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C8e/C8f: nested `Array<Array<T>>` mono order; free nested buffers on drop/clear/set.

### Generic Set + for-in collections (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C8g/C8h: `Set<T>`; `Set.get(i)` duck for-in; `for (k in map.keys)`.

### HashMap String→Int (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C8i: open addressing + `hash_string`; `hash_map()` capacity 16.

### Array field non-destructive bind (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C8j: bind/assign from field is view; return still moves (C7c).

### Lock registry schema v0 (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C8k: parse `version`/`source`/`checksum` inline tables; no fetch yet.

### Nullable primitive `Int?` / `Bool?` C emit (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C7a: `aura_opt_i64` / `aura_opt_bool` tagged structs; null/wrap/coerce; `== null` via `.has`; `!!` / `?:`; Map.get returns `Int?`. Corpus `types/opt_prim.aura`.

### GC mark / free Array fields (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C7b: `aura_gc_alloc_full` + per-class `dtor` (free Array buffers on sweep/shutdown) and `mark_extras` (mark Array-of-class field elems via `aura_gc_mark_ptr`). Corpus `class/gc_array_field.aura`.

### Multi-error collect deferred (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6h: body statements keep typechecking after an error; `SemaErrors` + CLI prints all. Corpus `diag/multi_error.aura`.
- C7g: declaration phase also collects (continue next decl); corpus `diag/multi_decl.aura`.

### Array fields shallow-copy on ctor/assign (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6i (partial): constructor and `var` field assign move from owner locals/params (zero source); reassign frees prior field buffer. Corpus `generic/array_field_move.aura`.

### GC mark does not walk Array-of-class locals (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6e (partial): `aura_gc_add_array_root` on Array-of-class locals/params; collect marks `data[0..len)`. Corpus `class/gc_array.aura`.

### Shallow GC mark only (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6a: store alloc size; worklist deep scan of pointer-sized slots in marked objects. Corpus `class/gc_deep.aura`.

### Array params not owners (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6b (partial): Array params own buffer; call site moves from owner idents. Corpus `generic/array_param_move.aura`.

### Array return binding not owner (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6d: `val b = f()` / assign from call that yields Array marks binding owner; free old on reassignment. Corpus `generic/array_return_own.aura`.

### No std.collections Map (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6f (partial): `Map` String→Int linear + `map()`; later C8a generic Map.

### `for-in` has no Iterable protocol (duck only) (2026-07-20)

- Resolved in C6c (partial): `for-in` on interface with `len(): Int` + `get(Int): E`; duck class path kept. Generic Iterable: C8d.
